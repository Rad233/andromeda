### What's New:

* Patched a compatibility issue with Fabrication's "Toggleable furnace carts" and "Furnace Minecarts Take Fuel When Low"
* Furnace Carts will also search for fuel every second instead of every half-second.
* Added modloader to optional data. Used to see Fabric/Quilt usage.
* Updated Dark Matter.
