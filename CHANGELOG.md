### What's New:

This version adds [Commander](https://modrinth.com/mod/cmd) support to two modules and so, to use those modules you must install commander.

[`blocks/incubator`]:

* Processing time now accepts [Expressions](https://constellation-mc.github.io/commander/Expressions). (context: `block_state`, `block_entity`, `tool`, `origin`)
* The list of Brigadier (`/`) commands was replaced by Commander [commands](https://constellation-mc.github.io/commander/Commands). (context: `this_entity`, `block_state`, `block_entity`, `tool`, `origin`)

[`entities/slimes`]:

* Collision particles are now slime type specific.

[`mechanics/throwable_items`]:

* Changed the data pack format to support Commander. Consult the wiki for more info.

[`general`]:
